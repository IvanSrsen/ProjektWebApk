			<h1 style="color:dimgray">Patch Notes 10.8. and Jungle changes</h1>
			<p class="description">This patch, we’ve got another follow-up to the funnel mechanics and a couple of wider jungle changes that should help with pacing, mainly around early game impact.</p>
			<p>We’re slightly reducing how much a gank will punish an enemy, and giving junglers a steadier stream of XP mid to late game.</p>
			<p>These adjustments should help you bounce back and stabilize from early setbacks.</p>
			<p>With this, we're helping out players who aren't hyper-optimizing their jungle clearing, giving them some breathing room with extra sustain so they're not always punished for taking a a little too much damage from a Raptor.</p>
			<p>We're also adding a couple of QoL changes to things like champion ability timers to better indicate how much time you have on an ability's cast or empowerment and the Practice Tool. Be sure to check those out!</p>

			<h2>Death Changes</h2>
			<p>We're adjusting the potential teams have to snowball early to make sure that your games don't go wildly out of control as often and give teams more chances to participate in an even game. Kill experience coupled with Homeguards means that early kills are still very powerful, but they're not quite as game-ending as before. Shifting the type of kills to solo ones also help give individual agency, which is something we still want to promote, especially since we're seeing such a heavy skew towards shared kills.</p>
			<p>We understand these pacing changes may hurt the jungle more than other roles, but we're making sure that we put back power into places that make sense for the role. (Read below for more information on that)</p>
			
			<p>NEW PITY ZOOMS On death, gain a smaller version of Homeguards which gives the player about 2.5 seconds less time to get back to lane</p>
			<p>NEW LONE WOLF At levels 1-6, a champion's solo kills grant 20% more experience and assisted kills grant 20% less experience. At levels 7-8, these numbers are reduced to 10%</p>
			
			<p>Coven Morgana, Coven LeBlanc, Coven Zyra, and Coven Zyra Prestige Edition will be available on Patch release. </p><br />
