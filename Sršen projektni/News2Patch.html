			<p class="description">Running it down—we’ve got a couple tweaks here, from Fiddlesticks to Lux, but the real meat of the patch is focused on the Marksman class (yes, it’s here!).</p>
			<p>It’s clear that marksmans have been struggling for a while. Their squishiness makes it difficult to stay alive in lane, especially in the critical early phases of the game.</p>
			<p>To remedy this, we’re bringing some power back with a two-step dance: drawing up health stats, and boosting their late game mobility through some items we’ve amped up, so that players can still go for exciting plays without getting as punished for it.</p>
			<p>It also doesn’t hurt to have more pep in your step.</p>
			<p>With that being said, we wanted to take a closer look at marksman champions who can solo lane and aren’t as dependent on their supports (Lucian, Vayne, Tristana, Kalista).</p>
			<p>We wanted to give them an equal amount of power as their peers while making sure it wasn’t skewed towards their solo lanes, so we’ve distinguished other treats for these folks that more accurately hit the mark!</p>
			<p>So get on the Rift, where you can use all this knowledge to make your enemies see stars. And, you know, longer death timers.</p>

			<p>The marksman class has major durability problems, especially in the early laning phase where their power feels heavily reliant on their supports. This has been causing issues in gameplay satisfaction since a marksman's strength relies on the length of time they're alive. By increasing their mobility (via items) and base health, we feel that ADCs won't be punished so aggressively when they fail and will still have a chance to bounce back and unlock their power in fights.</p>
			<p>	That being said, we've heard your concerns about the bot lane marksman champions that can also solo lane like Lucian and Vayne. We're giving them a separate set of changes which you can find more details on below.</p>
			<p>	We’ve also omitted Corki, Kindred, Quinn, Senna, and Graves due to having their primary playrate in other lanes, with the understanding that Senna may be considered for similar changes in the coming patches.</p>
